# Week 2 Exercise

This week's exercise is a basic todo list web app. This will require DOM manipulation with javascript. I recommend watching the following YouTube videos to help understand this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y17RuWkWdn8 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3odgpghXzY.

The starter files can be found in the todo-list folder.

## Features
- Display tasks
- Add a task
- Remove a task
- Display current date at top
- Challenge: make it persistent i.e. list isn't cleared on refresh
