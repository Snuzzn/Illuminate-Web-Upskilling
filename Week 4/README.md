## Week 4 Exercises

This week's exercises involve adding a few features to the shopping cart workshop we did earlier in the week. 

These features are:
- adding a 'total count' to the cart that tells the user the total number of items they've ordered so far
- if the count of a given item falls to 0, it should be removed entirely from the cart
- adding a checkout page which has a 'pay now' button that when clicked, switches to 'ordering now' for a few seconds
- Optional: if the count of a given item exceeds its maximum quantity (as given by the `maxQty` attribute in the data), then an error toast should be displayed
  - You can install the `react-toastify` package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) which lets you do this with one simple line of code. 

Here's a video demo of these features:
